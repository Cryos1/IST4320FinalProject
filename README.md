# Secure Password Manager

For this Final Project I decided to create a password manager that continues from the previous activity where I created a secure password generator.

My password manager allows me to enter a website name, username and then I use the 'generate password' button to create a secure 12 character password for my login.

Once a password is generated, I then use the 'save password' button to store my passwords in the database. Additionally all fields must be filled in order to save the data.

The 'View passwords' button allows for another window to pop up and shows all the stored passwords I have created and stored

The 'View in Jupyter' button allows me to see all my logins in a table format through the jupyter tab, right under all my code.

## something I would do different or add to my code

I would like my passwords to be encrypted so they are not publicly visible or like create a login where I would need to login with a username and password before being able to store any passwords.

Basically I want to be able to have login screen when opening my app. also maybe if I can find a way to make an extension to add it to my browser so that I wouldn't have to access it only thorugh jupyter labs
